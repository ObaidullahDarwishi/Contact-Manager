# Contact Manager

A simple Java console-based Contact Manager that allows users to manage personal contacts. The program supports:

- Adding new contacts
- Viewing all saved contacts
- Sorting contacts alphabetically by name (using Merge Sort)
- Searching for a contact by name (using Binary Search)
- Removing a contact

Each contact stores:
- Name
- Phone Number
- Email Address
- Home Address
- Birthday
- Notes

## Technologies Used
- Java
- ArrayList
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Merge Sort (custom implementation)
- Binary Search (custom implementation)


## Why I Built This

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms. By building a real-world application like a contact manager, I was able to apply techniques like merge sort and binary search in a practical, user-focused way.
